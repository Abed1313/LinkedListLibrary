The DetectCycle method is designed to determine whether a singly linked list contains a cycle (i.e., a situation where a node's next pointer points to a previous node in the list). Here’s a detailed breakdown of how this method works:

Explanation:
Check for Empty or Single Node List:

The method first checks if the Head is null or if there's only one node in the list (Head.Next == null). If either condition is true, the method returns false since a cycle cannot exist in an empty list or a list with a single node.
Initialize Pointers:

Two pointers are initialized: fast and slow, both pointing to the Head of the linked list. These pointers will be used to traverse the list at different speeds.
Traverse the List:

A while loop (while (fast != null && fast.Next != null)) runs as long as fast is not null and fast.Next is not null. This ensures that we do not go out of bounds while accessing the Next property.
Advance Pointers:

Inside the loop:
The fast pointer moves one step forward (fast = fast.Next).
The slow pointer moves two steps forward (slow = slow.Next.Next).
This means that fast moves at double the speed of slow.
Cycle Detection:

The method checks if fast and slow pointers meet (if(fast.Next == slow.Next)). If they do, this indicates a cycle, and the method returns true.
Advance Fast Pointer Again:

The fast pointer is advanced again (fast = fast.Next). This line may lead to unnecessary steps since the cycle detection logic is already established when checking for equality. It can be omitted to simplify the logic.
Return False:

If the loop completes without finding a cycle, the method returns false, indicating that the linked list does not contain a cycle.
Key Points:
Purpose: To detect if there is a cycle in the linked list.
Logic: The method uses the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, where slow moves one step at a time while fast moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The worst-case scenario involves visiting each node at most twice.
Space Complexity: O(1), as the method uses a fixed number of pointers regardless of the list size.
Potential Improvements:
Correct Condition for Cycle Detection: The check if (fast.Next == slow.Next) should be corrected to if (fast == slow) since we are trying to determine if the two pointers meet, not if their next nodes are the same.
