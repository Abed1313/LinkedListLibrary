The RemoveLast method is designed to remove the last node from a singly linked list.

Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works:

Check if the list is empty:

The first condition if (Head == null) { return; } checks if the list is empty by verifying if the Head is null. If it is, the method returns immediately, as there is no node to remove.
Find the second-to-last node:

The method creates a variable current and sets it to the Head, starting the traversal of the list from the first node.
The while loop (while(current.Next.Next != null)) traverses the list until current.Next.Next is null, which means current will point to the second-to-last node (the node right before the last one). This loop ensures that the code does not go beyond the second-to-last node.
Remove the last node:

After exiting the loop, current.Next = null; sets the Next pointer of the second-to-last node to null, effectively removing the last node from the list. The reference to the last node is lost, and it will be removed by the garbage collector (if applicable).
Return:

The method ends with a return statement, ensuring control is passed back to the calling method after completing the removal.
Key Points:
Purpose: Removes the last element in a singly linked list.
Logic: The method finds the second-to-last node and updates its Next pointer to null, removing the reference to the last node.
Edge Case: It only handles cases where there are at least two nodes. If there is only one node, this method would fail, as it assumes current.Next.Next exists.
Potential Issue: The method will throw an exception if there is only one node in the list (because current.Next.Next doesn't exist). To fix this, an additional check should be added to handle the case when there is only one node.
