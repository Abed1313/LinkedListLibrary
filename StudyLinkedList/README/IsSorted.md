The IsSorted method is designed to determine whether the elements in a singly linked list are sorted in ascending order. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how it works:

Explanation:
Initialize Pointer:

The method starts by initializing a pointer called current to the Head of the linked list. This pointer is used to traverse the list.
Traverse the List:

The while loop (while (current.Next != null)) continues as long as current is not pointing to the last node (i.e., until current.Next is not null). This ensures that comparisons are made between each node and its next node.
Check for Order:

Inside the loop, the method checks if the data of the current node is greater than the data of the next node (if (current.Data > current.Next.Data)). If this condition is true, it indicates that the list is not sorted in ascending order, and the method immediately returns false.
Continue Traversing:

If the current node’s data is less than or equal to the next node’s data, the method updates current to current.Next to continue traversing the list.
Return Result:

If the loop completes without finding any unsorted elements, the method returns true, indicating that the list is sorted in ascending order.
Key Points:
Purpose: To check if the linked list's elements are sorted in ascending order.
Logic:
The method iterates through the list, comparing adjacent nodes to verify their order.
Return Type: The return type is bool, indicating whether the list is sorted (true) or not (false).
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: The method runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since it may need to check each node once.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the list size (just a pointer variable).
Potential Improvements:
Handle Empty List: Although an empty list is technically sorted, you may want to add an explicit check at the beginning of the method to handle this case, depending on your definition of "sorted."
