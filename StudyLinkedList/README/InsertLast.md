Method: InsertLast(int data)
[Link]()

The InsertLast method appends a new node containing the specified data to the end of a singly linked list.

Node Creation: A new node is created with the provided data and is initialized with Next = null by default.

Empty List Handling: If the list is currently empty (i.e., Head is null), the new node becomes the head of the list.

Traversing the List: If the list is not empty, the method traverses the list starting from the Head, moving through each node until it reaches the last node (which has Next = null).

Insertion at the End: Once the last node is found, the new node is appended by setting the Next property of the current last node to point to the new node.

This method ensures that the new node is always added at the end, maintaining the order of elements in the linked list.
