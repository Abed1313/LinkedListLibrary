Description of the IsPalindrome Method
[Link]()

The IsPalindrome method checks whether the elements in a linked list form a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. Here’s a breakdown of how the method works:

Empty or Single Node Check:

The method begins by checking if the linked list is empty (i.e., Head is null) or contains only one node (i.e., Head.Next is null). In both cases, it returns true, as an empty list or a single-node list is trivially a palindrome.
Finding the Middle of the List:

Two pointers, fast and slow, are initialized to the head of the list. The slow pointer advances by one node at a time, while the fast pointer advances by two nodes at a time. This technique allows the method to find the middle of the list.
When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the midpoint (or just past it for lists with an even number of nodes).
Reversing the Second Half:

After locating the midpoint, the method calls a helper function (not shown in the code snippet) to reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the slow pointer. This creates a new linked list that is the reverse of the second half.
Comparing the Two Halves:

The method then initializes two pointers: firstHalf, starting at the head of the original list, and secondHalf, starting at the head of the reversed second half.
It iterates through both halves simultaneously, comparing the data in the nodes. If any of the corresponding values are different, the method returns false, indicating that the linked list is not a palindrome.
Returning the Result:

If all corresponding nodes match, the method returns true, confirming that the linked list is a palindrome.
Summary
Overall, the IsPalindrome method efficiently determines if the linked list is a palindrome by utilizing the two-pointer technique to find the midpoint, reversing the second half, and then comparing both halves. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), as it does not use additional data structures that scale with input size.
