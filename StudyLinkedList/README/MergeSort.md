The MergeSort method is an implementation of the merge sort algorithm specifically for merging two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list. Here's a detailed breakdown of its implementation:

Explanation:
Base Case for Recursion:

The method first checks if either list1 or list2 is null. If list1 is null, it returns list2 as the merged list. Conversely, if list2 is null, it returns list1. This handles the edge cases where one or both lists are empty.
Initialize Merged List:

A new Node called mergeSort is created, which acts as a placeholder to build the merged linked list.
A pointer current is initialized to point to mergeSort. This pointer will be used to keep track of the end of the merged list as it is constructed.
Iterate Through Both Lists:

A while loop is used to traverse both list1 and list2 as long as neither of them is null. Inside the loop:
It compares the Data values of the nodes at the heads of list1 and list2.
If the Data of list1 is less than or equal to that of list2, the Next pointer of current is set to the list1 node. Then, the list1 pointer is advanced to the next node (list1 = list1.Next).
If the Data of list2 is less, the same operation is performed but with the list2 node.
After determining which node to add to the merged list, the current pointer is advanced to its Next.
Attach Remaining Nodes:

After exiting the loop, the method checks if either list1 or list2 still has nodes left:
If list1 is not null, the remaining nodes of list1 are attached to the merged list by setting current.Next = list1.
If list2 is not null, the remaining nodes of list2 are attached in the same way.
Return Merged List:

Finally, the method returns mergeSort.Next, which points to the head of the newly merged linked list (skipping the initial placeholder node).
Key Points:
Purpose: To merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
Logic: The method uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently compare nodes from both lists and construct the merged list in sorted order.
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes in list1 and m is the number of nodes in list2. The method iterates through both lists only once.
Space Complexity: O(1), as the merging process is done in place without using extra space for new nodes (beyond the initial placeholder).
Potential Improvements:
Use a Dummy Node: The method uses a dummy node (mergeSort) to simplify the merging process, which is a common and effective technique in linked list operations.
