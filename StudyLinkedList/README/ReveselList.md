The ReveselList (which should be spelled "ReverseList") method is designed to reverse a singly linked list. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

Explanation:
Initialize Pointers:

The method starts by initializing three pointers:
previous, set to null, will eventually become the new head of the reversed list.
current, initialized to Head, to traverse the original linked list.
next, initialized to null, will temporarily store the next node in the original list during traversal.
Traverse and Reverse the Links:

The while loop (while (current != null)) continues until it reaches the end of the list (when current becomes null).
Inside the loop:
next = current.Next; stores the next node before changing the current node's pointer. This is crucial because the pointer to the next node will be modified in the next step.
current.Next = previous; reverses the pointer of the current node, making it point to the previous node instead of the next one.
previous = current; moves the previous pointer one step forward, now pointing to the current node.
current = next; advances the current pointer to the next node in the original list.
Set the New Head:

After the loop completes, the original list has been fully traversed and reversed. The Head of the linked list is then updated to point to the previous node, which is now the first node of the reversed list.
Key Points:
Purpose: To reverse the order of nodes in a singly linked list.
Logic:
The method effectively changes the direction of the pointers in the linked list, reversing the sequence of nodes.
Time Complexity: The method runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the list, since it traverses the list once.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1), as it uses a fixed number of pointers regardless of the size of the list.
Potential Improvements:
The method currently does not handle the case where the list is empty. Although the while loop would exit without doing anything in that case, you might want to add a check at the beginning to provide feedback (e.g., a message indicating that the list is empty). However, it's not strictly necessary since reversing an empty list should logically still yield an empty list.
