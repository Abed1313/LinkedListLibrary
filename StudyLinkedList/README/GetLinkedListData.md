Description of the GetLinkedListData Method
[Link]()

The GetLinkedListData method retrieves all the data values from a linked list and returns them as an array. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the method works:

Parameter:

The method takes a single parameter, linkedList, which represents the linked list from which data will be extracted. However, note that the parameter is not actually used within the method.
Initialization:

A pointer named current is initialized to the head of the linked list (assumed to be the calling instance of the class, as there is no mention of linkedList.Head).
An empty list of integers, result, is created to store the data values of the nodes as they are traversed.
Traversal:

The method enters a while loop that continues as long as current is not null. This loop is used to traverse through the linked list.
Inside the loop, the data from the current node is added to the result list using the Add method.
The current pointer is then moved to the next node in the list by updating it to current.Next.
Returning the Result:

Once the loop completes (indicating that all nodes have been traversed), the method converts the result list to an array using the ToArray method and returns this array.
Summary
In summary, the GetLinkedListData method provides a way to collect all the data values from a linked list and return them in a standard array format. It efficiently traverses the linked list, accumulating each node's data in a list, and then converts that list into an array before returning it. The method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as it must visit each node to collect its data.
