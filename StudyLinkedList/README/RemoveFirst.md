This method, RemoveFirst, is designed to remove the first node from a singly linked list.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

Check if the list is empty:

The first if statement (if (Head == null) { return; }) checks if the Head (the first node in the list) is null. If the list is empty (i.e., Head is null), the method simply returns, as there is nothing to remove.
Update the head:

If the list is not empty (Head != null), the second block executes, where the Head is updated to the next node in the list (Head = Head.Next).
This effectively removes the first node by making the second node the new head of the list. If there is only one node, this sets the head to null, making the list empty.
Key Points:
Purpose: To remove the first element from a singly linked list.
Edge Case: Handles an empty list by returning immediately.
Efficiency: The method runs in constant time, O(1), since it only involves reassigning the head pointer.
