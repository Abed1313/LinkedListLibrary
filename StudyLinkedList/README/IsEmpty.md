The IsEmpty method is intended to check whether a singly linked list is empty. However, the implementation has some redundancies and a potential logical flaw. Here's a detailed breakdown of the method, along with suggestions for improvement:

Explanation:
Initialize Pointer:

The method starts by initializing a pointer called current to the Head of the linked list. This pointer is used to check the state of the list.
Check for Empty List:

The first if statement checks if current (i.e., Head) is null. If it is, the method returns true, indicating that the list is empty.
Redundant Check:

The second if statement checks if current.Data is not null. This is unnecessary because if current is null, the first if statement would have already returned true. Additionally, in a well-defined linked list, Data should not be null unless the list is implemented to allow such a case.
Return Value:

If current.Data is not null, the method returns false, indicating that the list is not empty. The final return statement return true; is unreachable and thus unnecessary.
Suggested Improvements:
To simplify the method, you can directly check if the Head is null. Here’s a refined version of the IsEmpty method:

public bool IsEmpty()
{
    return Head == null; // Return true if Head is null, indicating the list is empty
}
Key Points:
Purpose: To determine if the linked list is empty.
Logic: The method checks if the Head of the list is null to conclude if the list is empty.
Return Type: The return type is bool, indicating whether the list is empty (true) or not (false).
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(1), as it only checks the Head pointer.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the list size.
