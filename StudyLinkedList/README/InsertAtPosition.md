The InsertAtPosition method is designed to insert a new node with specified data into a linked list at a given position.

Parameters:

The method takes two inputs: the position where the new node should be inserted and the data that the new node will contain.
Insertion at the Head:

If the specified position is 1, the new node will be inserted at the beginning of the list. The new node's next pointer will point to the current head of the list, and then the head will be updated to the new node.
Traversal:

If the position is greater than 1, the method will traverse the linked list to find the node that is currently at the position just before the desired insertion point. This is done by starting at the head of the list and moving through each node, counting the positions until the correct spot is found.
Boundary Checks:

The method checks if the specified position is out of bounds (i.e., greater than the length of the list). If it is, the method will indicate that the position is invalid.
Node Insertion:

Once the correct position is identified, the method adjusts the pointers so that the new node is inserted between the previous node and the next node. The new node’s next pointer is set to point to the node that was previously next, and the previous node’s next pointer is updated to point to the new node.
Efficiency:

The method operates with a time complexity that can vary depending on the position of insertion but is generally linear, as it may need to traverse a portion or all of the list. The space complexity is constant since it does not use additional data structures that grow with the input size.
Summary
Overall, the InsertAtPosition method is a flexible way to add nodes to a linked list at any specified location, while ensuring that the linked structure remains intact and that boundary conditions are handled gracefully.
